                <p>After the first week of grouping, the teacher showed us drone delivery. We have a preliminary understanding of future delivery. There are many autonomous vehicles exist, e.g. Self-driving vehicle, Amazon delivery. As Stewart shows at the lecture, autonomous vehicles have completely changed people's way of life and travel. Therefore, for our assessment concept, we want to design an autonomous furniture delivery vehicle. We researched on the internet. For those travelling by public transport/taxi, they can book a car that fits they want. Ikea will pack the furniture then customers can drive home easily. I went to the Ikea with my friends who will move the apartment, it's an excellent chance to personally experience the IKEA shopping process. </p>

For large pieces of furniture that can only be delivered to the home the next day, they feel a little troubled because they need to spare time to wait for delivery.</p>

                <p>During the group discussion in the second week, we found a better idea, the autonomous shopping cart. Compared with Ikea delivery, the shopping cart has fewer restrictions and is closer to our daily life. What we want to design first is the autonomous shopping cart could automatically follow the customer and help the customer find the desired product. Then we started to do the research plan. While the first assessment is individual, but we still want to avoid unnecessary repetition. Therefore, Jack would do the interview and contextual observation near the Coles, Ben do the interview and space-mapping, and I plan to do the questionary and interview at the Woolworths. I also ask for an interview with my roommate, friends.

                <p>What I want to do the questionnaires are the questionnaires have little to no cost, it could be placed on the social media or email. Also, the questionnaires could collect the results fast and easy.

The interview could collect sufficient information, also face to face data collection could receive abstract factors like attitudes, feelings and so on.

Therefore we both have quality and quantity research methods.</p>

                <p>At week 3, we started doing the research. I placed the questionnaires on the social media and email, using the google forms. The results show customers prefer to use the trolleys at a supermarket. What’s more, This result shows customers prefer to use the self check-out system. As the feedback of interview, customers do not want to stand in a long queue to check out.they don’t like waste time to search for the specific items. Therefore, we figure out the main problem of our application. I also went to the supermarket to record my daily shopping experience. As a user, during my search for specific items, I occasionally could not find the items I wanted, and the supermarket staff often looked very busy, which makes me embarrassed to ask.</p>

                <p>We started drawing the storyboard. We discussed a lot of ideas. We decided to divide the work, one person to do an interface. I was doing the first idea, which is an interface base on the iPad size, Like the vending machine, people could choose the items they want on the screen, the system could pack up all the pieces, using the Conveyor belt (conveyor belt). Customers could pick up the items easily, do not need to walk into the supermarket. Then Jack continued the second idea, an interface base on the iPad, it will be placed on the shopping cart, the cart will lead customers to find want they want. The third idea, Ben will design an interface based on the smartphone.
After Jackson gave advice, we decided to develop the second and third ideas, those are more related to the autonomous vehicle, and more free for consumers to use.</p>

Users could scan the QR code on the cart, then the cart will link to the smartphone's Bluetooth, It will autonomous following the users during they shopping at the supermarket. The concept of idea 2 storyboards is there is a screen like iPad on the cart. After users enter the item they want, the screen will turn to the AR navigation page, customers could easily find the pieces following the trolley. All the payment could complete on the applications, based on the feedback of users research, people prefer to check out by themselves. I used colour lead to make the audiences know our concepts more quickly and at a glance.</p>

                <p>After finished the storyboard, we started doing the low-fidelity paper prototype and wireframes. According to Jackson's suggestion, our application should more relate to the function of finding goods, rather than the traditional shopping application. Our team made several changes to the low-fidelity paper prototype. We first tested ourselves many times and created user flow, hoping to allow users to use our products more smoothly. Based on the Think aloud and interview, we evaluated our 2 concepts with 16 users. Through interviews, we change a lot based on respondents feedback. Our design goal is to satisfy the needs of most people. According to feedback, we finally decided to let our products be used on smartphones because it’s more flexible, user fell more controlled over the autonomous device.</p>

                <p>According to assessment 1 and 2, 3times evaluation, I think the primary demand of customers is: Fast and Easy to find the items they want, free to change minds during navigation. According to the respondents, we deleted the freshness detect function, the user feels awkward and confused about this function.
We also added a pause button in our application. When the users in the process of looking for items, if they want to stop the navigation for a while, they can press the pause button and press again to continue navigation. After entering the product name, different from the previous version, we've added fields for users to choose different brands they want, it allows users more freedom to choose their favourite brands. We also added the "Add to shopping list" & "Navigation" icons. Instead of only text, we use icons and text together to make the users. The simple interface makes it easier for users to use our application. After iteration and Constantly modified of our wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes of those 2 concepts, we started making the digital wireframes using the sketch.</p>

                <p>I started making the digital wireframes in Sketch this week. From the tutorial, I learned to use the basic usage of Invision, Sketch, Pop, which are practical tools to make the initial low-fidelity prototype, which could provide a better test experience for the respondents. According to the teammates Ben and Jack's paper prototype, we discussed and decided the final version together. Refining the excellent functions of both concepts, we also add the home page and shopping list page. The shopping list feature is the most distinctive part of our application. The users can import what they want to buy into the shopping list at any time, in advance or during the shopping process. They can also delete items they don't want to buy at any time. This makes our application more flexible to meet the needs of users. In contrast to the initial version, we can see that we have abandoned a lot and added a lot of functions. This made me understand the importance of user research and evaluation, and it is an indispensable round in the design process. All our design needs expand around USERS.</p>

Finally completed the second assessment. For this assessment, we completed the basic interface design, so that users can easily find the goods they want in the supermarket.

                <p>We started to improve our digital wireframes this week, to make the high-fidelity visual mock-up. According to Jackson's advice, the functionality of our application is a bit confusing. We combine the scan pages into one; Add the skip function instead of pause function; Add more pop out windows that enhance the interactivity of our application. As the shopping list and navigation functions are the main functions of our application, therefore, we have changed our interface. To make users not easily confused. We mainly have two modes of operation. The first one, users import the shopping list in advance before shopping. They can use the search function to find the products they want, then save the shopping list. When customers arrive at the supermarket, they scan QR-code on the autonomous shopping cart, then start shopping. Following the AR navigation on the smartphone, the application will lead the users to find the items. If the user does not import in advance, or temporarily add items into the shopping list, they could press the Shopping Cart button to add the items whenever they want.Then we import our interfaces into Invison, improve the degree of completion of the Interactive prototype. Finally, we let our friends test it.</p>

                <p>Based on user feedback, we made a lot of improvements this week. Indicator: We show the number in the upper right corner of the shopping list, indicating how many items have been added to the shopping list. On the navigation page, we added a flip button that allows the user to switch between the navigation page and the shopping list quickly. The product description of items already placed in the shopping cart will be lightened, and the strikethrough will be added. The font of the Current navigating product's description will be bold to notice the users. We also added a progress bar to display the progress of the purchase. These improvements are designed to give users a clearer picture of their shopping progress during the shopping process. Then we finished the final interactive prototype of our project using the Invison. Also, we went to the supermarket to test our application with the real scene. We made a video then I used the final cut to edit the video.</p>
